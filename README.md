# Airbnb Clone Project
A full-stack web application that simulates a real-world booking platform like Airbnb. This project focuses on backend systems, database design, RESTful APIs, and security, offering hands-on experience with scalable architecture and collaborative development workflows.

## üöÄ Project Goals

- **Understand Full-Stack Architecture**  
  Gain practical experience building both frontend and backend components of a scalable web application.

- **Implement Backend Systems**  
  Design and develop core backend features such as user authentication, data persistence, and session management.

- **Design and Integrate Databases**  
  Model real-world entities (users, places, bookings) using relational databases and apply ORM principles.

- **Develop RESTful APIs**  
  Create robust, well-documented APIs to handle user interaction, CRUD operations, and system integrations.

- **Apply Application Security Best Practices**  
  Implement secure user authentication, input validation, and permission handling to protect sensitive data.

- **Practice Scalable Design Patterns**  
  Use modular, maintainable code structures that support scalability and future feature growth.

- **Foster Team Collaboration**  
  Collaborate in a team setting using version control (Git), issue tracking, code reviews, and clear communication.

- **Simulate Real-World Workflow**  
  Follow industry-standard development practices, including Agile methodology, continuous integration, and testing.

## üë• Team Roles

### Core Roles
- **Backend Developer**  
  Implements business logic, API endpoints, authentication, and server-side workflows.

- **Database Administrator (DBA)**

  Defines project vision, prioritizes backlog, and ensures the end product aligns with business goals.

- **Project Manager / Scrum Master**  
  Coordinates tasks, manages timelines, removes blockers, and maintains Agile workflows.

- **Software Architect / Tech Lead**  
  Oversees system architecture, enforces coding standards, and guides technical design decisions.

- **Frontend Developer** *(if applicable)*  
  Implements user interfaces and interacts with APIs to deliver smooth user experiences.

- **UX/UI Designer**  
  Crafts wireframes, prototypes, and ensures a user-centered design and intuitive interface.

- **Business Analyst**  
  Bridges business needs and technical requirements; refines user stories and functional specifications.

- **Test Automation Engineer**  
  Builds and maintains automated test suites, integrating them into CI/CD to ensure fast, reliable feedback.
