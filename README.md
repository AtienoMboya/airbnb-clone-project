## ✨ Feature Breakdown

### 🔐 User Management
Handles user registration, login, authentication, and role assignment (guest or host). Secure password handling and session/token-based authentication ensure user data is protected and access is properly managed.

### 🏠 Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes detailed descriptions, location data, and availability, allowing guests to browse and select suitable options.

### 📅 Booking System
Allows guests to book available properties for specific dates. The system validates availability, prevents booking conflicts, and manages check-in/check-out logic.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Integrates secure payment workflows for confirmed bookings. Tracks transactions, verifies payment status, and ensures reliable financial reporting and data integrity.

### ⭐ Reviews & Ratings
Enables guests to leave feedback and rate properties after their stay. This feature builds trust and transparency on the platform, helping future guests make informed decisions.

### 📬 Notifications (Optional/Future Feature)
Supports email or in-app alerts for booking confirmations, cancellations, and reminders. Keeps users informed and improves overall user experience.

### ⚙️ Admin Dashboard (Optional/Future Feature)
Provides superusers or staff with tools to monitor platform activity, manage users, and moderate listings or reviews.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a critical component of this platform, especially as it handles sensitive user data, property listings, and financial transactions. The following key measures will be implemented to ensure the API is secure and trustworthy:

### ✅ Authentication
User identities will be verified using secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication. This ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

**Why it matters:**  
Authentication is the first line of defense against impersonation and unauthorized actions. It protects user accounts and secures access to personal and transactional data.

### ✅ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to manage permissions for different types of users (e.g., hosts vs. guests). API endpoints will be protected to ensure users can only perform actions allowed for their role.

**Why it matters:**  
Authorization prevents misuse of the system by ensuring users can only access or modify the resources they are permitted to. For example, a guest should not be able to edit another user’s property listing.

### ✅ Rate Limiting
Rate limiting will be applied to prevent abuse, such as brute-force login attempts or spamming API requests. This is especially important for publicly accessible endpoints like authentication and search.

**Why it matters:**  
Rate limiting protects the API from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensures fair usage for all users.

### ✅ Data Validation and Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks, malformed input, and accidental data corruption.

**Why it matters:**  
Proper validation and sanitization prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and logic errors that could compromise system integrity.

### ✅ Secure Payment Handling
Payment endpoints will be secured with HTTPS, and all interactions with the payment gateway will use encrypted tokens and secure APIs.

**Why it matters:**  
Payments involve sensitive financial data. Proper security measures are essential to prevent fraud, protect cardholder information, and comply with standards like PCI-DSS.

### ✅ HTTPS and Secure Headers
The entire application will be served over HTTPS, and appropriate security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options) will be set.

**Why it matters:**  
Encrypting data in transit and enforcing security headers helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and other web-based threats.

---

Security will be continuously monitored and updated as the project evolves, following industry best practices and guidelines like OWASP Top 10.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It is a set of automated processes that enable developers to build, test, and deploy code more efficiently and reliably. Every time new code is pushed to the repository, the CI/CD pipeline ensures it is automatically tested and, if successful, deployed to the appropriate environment.

### Why It Matters

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline helps:
- Detect and fix bugs early through automated testing
- Speed up the development cycle with frequent, reliable deployments
- Maintain code quality and reduce manual errors
- Enable seamless collaboration across team members

### Tools Used

This project leverages the following tools in the CI/CD process:

- **GitHub Actions** – Automates testing, linting, and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Docker** – Ensures consistent development, testing, and production environments using containerization.
- **Celery & Redis** – Asynchronous task management used in background jobs can also be managed as part of deployment.
- **PostgreSQL** – Database service configuration and migrations can be automated as part of the pipeline.
- **(Optional)** Deployment platforms like **Heroku**, **Render**, or **AWS** can be integrated into the pipeline for automatic delivery to staging or production.

---

The CI/CD setup ensures that code pushed to the main branch meets quality standards and is production-ready.
